How to transfer a domain from AWS Route 53 to Cloudflare. This process might seem a bit complicated, but we'll break it down into manageable steps to ensure a smooth transition.

If you haven't seen our previous video on transferring a domain from GoDaddy to AWS, you can check it out for reference. Now, let's dive into the process of moving a domain from AWS to Cloudflare.
[Refer How To Transfer Your Domain from GoDaddy to AWS](https://www.arinatechnologies.com/posts/godaddy-aws)

## Step 1: Preparing the Domain for Transfer
![AWS Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/route53.webp)
Before we proceed, ensure you have:
- Access to your AWS Route 53 account.
- A Cloudflare account ready for the transfer.

In AWS Route 53:
![AWS Route 53](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/registerdomains.webp)
1. Navigate to the **Registered Domains** section in the AWS Management Console.
2. Find the domain you want to transfer.
3. Before initiating the transfer, disable **Auto-Renew** for this domain. This prevents automatic renewal during the transfer process.
4. Turn off the **Transfer Lock** to allow other registrars, like Cloudflare, to accept the domain. This change may take a few minutes to propagate.

## Step 2: Obtain the Authorization Code
![Authorization Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/authorizationcode.webp)
![Transfer Out](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/transferout.webp)
1. In the **Registered Domains** section, look for the **Transfer Out** option.
2. Click on **Transfer to Another Registrar** and request the **Authorization Code**. AWS will generate a code for you. Copy this code, as it will be needed to authorize the transfer to Cloudflare.

## Step 3: Starting the Transfer on Cloudflare
![Domain Registration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/domainregistering.webp)
1. Go to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) and log into your account.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to the **Domain Registration** section.
![Transfer Domain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/transferdomains.webp) 
3. Choose the **Transfer Domain** option and enter the domain name you wish to transfer. Click **Continue**.
4. If you haven't already added the domain in Cloudflare, you'll be prompted to do so now. Enter the domain name and click **Continue**.

## Step 4: Updating Nameservers in AWS Route 53
![Nameservers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/nameservers.webp)
To successfully transfer your domain, you need to update the nameservers:
1. Go back to your AWS Route 53 account.
2. Navigate to the **Registered Domains** section and select your domain.
![Edit Name Servers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/editnameservers.webp)
3. Click on **Edit Name Servers**. Update the nameservers to the ones provided by Cloudflare.
4. *Always keep a backup of your original nameserver settings in case you need to revert changes.*
5. Save the changes. Note that DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours.

## Step 5: Validate the Nameservers

- After a few hours, return to your Cloudflare dashboard. Cloudflare will automatically validate the updated nameservers.
- Once validated, your domain will be marked as **Ready to Transfer** in Cloudflare.

## Step 6: Finalize the Transfer in Cloudflare
![Cloudflare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/requestauthorization.webp)
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, select the domain that is ready for transfer.
2. Enter the **Authorization Code** you copied from AWS Route 53.
3. Review the pricing details and add a payment method in Cloudflare to cover the transfer fee.
4. Confirm and proceed with the transfer. Cloudflare will then initiate the transfer process.

## Step 7: Approve the Transfer in AWS Route 53
![Approve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/approve.webp)
AWS will send an email to the domain's registered email address to approve the transfer:
1. Check your email and click the link provided to approve the domain transfer. This step is crucial to confirm that you consent to the transfer.
2. Approve the transfer in the AWS console to expedite the process.

## Step 8: Monitoring the Transfer
![Active](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinatechnologies/blogs/445678d36fdfea685c9e441b563bd471c98b9235/images/aws%20to%20cloudflare/managedomains.webp)
- The transfer might take a few hours to complete. You can monitor the status in the Cloudflare dashboard.
- Once the transfer is complete, the domain status in Cloudflare will change to **Active**.

## Step 9: Post-Transfer Configurations

1. Verify that the domain is properly set up in Cloudflare and that the DNS records are configured correctly.
2. Adjust any additional settings in Cloudflare, such as automatic renewals and domain locks.

#### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully transferred your domain from AWS Route 53 to Cloudflare. Remember, it's always a good idea to keep backups of your original settings and follow each step carefully to avoid any interruptions.
