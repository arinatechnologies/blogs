### What is Apache ActiveMQ?

Apache ActiveMQ is one of the oldest and most trusted open-source message brokers, designed to facilitate high-performance and reliable messaging across multiple protocols. Written in Java, it supports a diverse range of client APIs and offers features like message persistence, delivery guarantees, and advanced routing options. ActiveMQ is commonly used in enterprise environments where robustness and scalability are critical.

### Introduction to Artemis

Artemis, or ActiveMQ Artemis, is the modern successor to ActiveMQ Classic, aiming to address its architectural limitations and enhance scalability and modern feature support. Originating from the HornetQ codebase, Artemis brings improvements such as better performance, simplified clustering, and advanced features like data replication and backup servers.

### Key Features and Comparison.For any automation requirement or issues, please reach out to us[Read about Arina Consulting](https://www.arinatechnologies.com/consulting)

Both ActiveMQ and Artemis offer robust messaging solutions, but their approaches and capabilities differ in several ways:

**Performance and Storage:** ActiveMQ uses KahaDB for message persistence, which involves a journal and index for message storage. Artemis utilizes an append-only journal that doesn't require a separate index, leading to improved performance.<br/>
**Protocol Support:** ActiveMQ supports various protocols like MQTT, STOMP, and OpenWire. Artemis enhances this by offering a more extensive range of supported protocols and easier configuration, making it adaptable to more diverse environments.<br/>
**Clustering and High Availability:** While ActiveMQ provides basic clustering capabilities, Artemis offers more advanced clustering features with easier setup and automatic failover, making it a better choice for environments where high availability is crucial.<br/>
**Management and Configuration:** Artemis simplifies management through an updated configuration structure and provides out-of-the-box support for features like WebSockets, which are not as straightforward in ActiveMQ.

    <tr>
      <td>IO connectivity layer</td>
      <td>Uses tcp (synchronous one) and nio (non-blocking one)</td>
      <td>
        Implemented using Netty, which is a nio framework. Thus need to choose
        between different implementations as the non-blocking one is used by
        default. One acceptor can handle multiple messaging protocols on the
        same port. Web Sockets are supported out of the box. So, there's no need
        for the separate ws transport like in ActiveMQ, the tcp (Netty) acceptor
        in Artemis will detect Web Socket clients and handle them accordingly.

    <tr>
      <td>Message store</td>
      <td>
        Uses KahaDB that consists of a message journal for fast sequential
        storing of messages (and other command packets) and an index for
        retrieving messages when needed.
      </td>
      <td>
        Own message store, which consists only of the append-only message
        journal and doesn't require message index.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Paging (process that happens when broker can't hold all incoming
        messages in its memory)
      </td>
      <td>
        Uses cursors, which are basically a cache of messages ready to be
        dispatched to the consumer. Cursors try to keep all incoming messages in
        cache. When we run out of the available memory, messages are added to
        the store, but the caching stops. When the space become available again,
        the broker will fill the cache again by pulling messages from the store
        in batches. Because of this, we need to read the journal from time to
        time during a broker runtime. In order to do that, we need to maintain a
        journal index, so that messages' position can be tracked inside the
        journal.
      </td>
      <td>
        The whole message journal is kept in memory and messages are dispatched
        directly from it. When we run out of memory, messages are paged on the
        producer side (before they hit the broker). They are stored in
        sequential page files in the same order as they arrived. Once the memory
        is freed, messages are moved from these page files into the journal.
        With paging working like this, messages are read from the file journal
        only when the broker starts up, in order to recreate this in-memory
        version of the journal. In this case, the journal is only read
        sequentially, meaning that there's no need to keep an index of messages
        in the journal.

        Anycast routing is used implement point-to-point semantics, where
        there'll be only one queue for the address and all consumers will
        subscribe to it and this addressing and routing scheme is used across
        all protocols.

        message storage and ultimately duplicate delivery, which is not good.

The choice between ActiveMQ and Artemis largely depends on the specific needs of your project and environment. For applications requiring traditional robust messaging with proven reliability, ActiveMQ remains very relevant. However, for newer applications demanding more flexibility, scalability, and modern features, Artemis might be the better option.
